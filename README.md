# Module 6 Challenge: API Requests

In this module, we got hands-on with making and managing API requests in Python. We learned how to interact with web services, pull data from APIs, and handle the responses. The exercises showed us how to use API keys for secure access and how to work with JSON data. Overall, this module was key in understanding how to bring external data into our Python apps.

## Key Learnings

- API Requests in Python: We got comfortable using the requests library to send different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and handle data from web services.
- API Response Handling: We learned how to read and interpret API responses, including checking status codes and managing errors.
- Working with JSON Data: We practiced converting JSON data to Python dictionaries, modifying it, and turning it back into JSON, which is essential for dealing with API data.
- API Keys: We understood how to use API keys to securely access web services and ensure our requests are authenticated.
